<p>General information About the Project</p>
<p>In this project i build a database with my favourite courses from Coursera, <br>
with SQL Server Management Studio. The courses have different categories, <br>
such as Guided Projects, Specilizations etc. I have divided the project into <br>
3 phases which i describe every one of them down below with more details.</p>
<br>

Starting of by creating the table FavouriteCourses where i have the following <br>
column names (id, Course Associates with, Name of provider, how many <br>
are the courses that form the major course and what is the Type of the Course).<br>

such as ( 1, 'Excel / VBA', 'University of Davis', 3, Specialization). </p>
